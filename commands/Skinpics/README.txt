Each Folder has an Images and a Names folder containing .jpg's and .json's respectively.
To add another skin, simply add those two, and make sure the randomiser in the code includes the number,
i.e 27.jpg to be stored in the Images folder while 27.json containing the following code:
{"name":"<name of skin, delete the less than and greater than arrows>"}
